# Pawn (Classic) Sniper's Weights

[Pawn](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/pawn)

Important Note 1: The weights will not appear by themselves, there is still code in Pawn which is not fully classic compatible, the weights will work if you make copies of them.

Important Note 2: Currently the weights are just my own made up values, feel free to replace with your own.
